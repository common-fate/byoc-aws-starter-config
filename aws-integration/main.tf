# This stack creates two IAM roles for Common Fate to connect to your AWS organization - a read role, used for syncing data about your accounts and IAM Identity Center users, and a provision role used for assigning users to accounts.

# Documentation on the required IAM permissions can be found here: https://docs.commonfate.io/integrations/aws#configuring-common-fate

# This stack should be deployed into either:

# a) your AWS organization root account, or

# b) an account with delegated administration permissions for your IAM Identity Center instance
